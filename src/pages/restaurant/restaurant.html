              <p>Joy Yee Noodle opened in Evanston in 1994 and in Chinatown Square in 1996. We were the first in the midwest to offer
                Taiwanese style bubble teas. Going a step further, Joy Yee
                was the first to combine the South Asian fresh fruit
                freezes (smoothies) with the popular tapioca balls.
